# road planning 

The data collected from OpenStreetMap + NetworkX (OSMnx) was used for machine learning algorithms to build effective algorithms for dealing with route planning issues on already existing road networks. We made a simulation of cars' behavior on actual city roads. The data is stored in the format of a graph alongside with some related information, such as the nature of the area (commercial, residential, and industrial areas), traffic lights location, speed limit information, etc.
